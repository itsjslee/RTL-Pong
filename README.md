## Kappa Theta Pi Push to Prod Project
A Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a type of computer chip that can be reprogrammed to perform different tasks after it’s been manufactured. Unlike a regular processor that runs software, an FPGA allows you to create custom digital circuits, making it super flexible for applications like signal processing, AI, and hardware acceleration.

For our project, we will program an FPGA to emulate a classic Pong game. Using Verilog, a hardware description language (HDL), we will design and implement the game’s logic, including paddle movement, ball physics, and scorekeeping. To ensure reliability and correctness before deployment, we will first test our design in a digital FPGA simulator, allowing us to debug and refine our implementation before flashing it onto the physical hardware.
